                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my personal website! I’ve created this site with the aim of assisting with my job search in the private yachting industry.
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm currently navigating a career transition from the world of IT to the dynamic realm of private yachting. With over 6 years of experience as an application support specialist, I've decided to chart a new course and pursue opportunities in the yachting industry.
                    </p>

                    <p>Currently based in Antibes, France, I'm eagerly seeking my debut role aboard a yacht, either daywork or a position as junior deckhand.  My ultimate ambition is to leverage my IT expertise to become an AV/IT specialist on larger yachts.
                    </p>

                    <p>While I boast essential qualifications: the ENG1 and STCW basic certifications, what truly sets me apart is my diverse background in IT, programming, aviation, and manual labor. I’m confident these skills will seamlessly transition into the yachting realm.
                    </p>

                    <p>I'm drawn to yachting not just for the career prospects, but also for the lifestyle it offers. I'm passionate about continuously developing my skills, particularly in areas such as navigation and communication systems and scuba diving. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Collaborating within a team towards shared goals truly energizes me, and I'm excited to contribute my expertise as a crew member onboard a private yacht.
                    </p>

                    <p>I believe that a career in yachting will provide me with the lifestyle that I seek: developing my skills and interests, which include technologies such as navigation and communication aids and scuba diving. Working in a team with a common goal gives me energy. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Also, my hope is that eventually I can obtain a rotational position, so that I can focus in my free time on a passion of mine that is not directly related to yachting: hang gliding. A passion that keeps me balanced and inspired.
                    </p>

                    <p>Stay tuned for the forthcoming link to my CV. Thank you for visiting my site, and please excuse any temporary disarray—it's a work in progress!
